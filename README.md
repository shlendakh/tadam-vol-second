# Tadam Timer App

A simple, React-based Pomodoro timer designed to help manage productivity sessions and breaks. This app is an impression and variation on the theme of the [Tadam](https://tadamapp.com) application written by my close friend [radex](https://github.com/radex). Created as part of the FreeCodeCamp certification task.

## Features

- Customizable session and break durations.
- Audible notification sounds for transitions.
- Intuitive UI controls for managing your sessions.

The application should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.
